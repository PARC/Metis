/**
 * @file metis_HopByHopFragmenterer.h
 * @brief Implements a fragmenter for a hop-by-hop protocol
 *
 * The hop-by-hop fragmenter can be though of as a bi-directional queue.
 *
 * The receive process takes fragmented packets from the wire and reassembles them.  Once a packet is
 * reassembed, it is put on end of the receive queue.  The user can then pop a message of the top of
 * the receive queue and process it normally.
 *
 * The send process takes a potentially large input packet and fragments it in to pieces that are places
 * in order on the send queue.  The caller can then pop messages of the head of the send queue and
 * put them on the wire.
 *
 * In the next update, we probalby want to make the send queue and receive queue external so I/O and
 * message processing threads can access them directly.
